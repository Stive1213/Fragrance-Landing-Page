Fragrance Landing Page
A sleek and responsive landing page built to showcase an elegant collection of fragrances. This project highlights my skills in crafting user-friendly, visually appealing web experiences using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Smooth Animations: Snow effects, typewriter text, and scroll-based reveals using pure JavaScript.
Contact Form: Sends messages directly to my inbox with EmailJS integration.
Performance Optimized: Lightweight code with debounced events and lazy-loaded visuals.
Vanilla JS: No frameworks—just clean, efficient JavaScript.
Technologies
HTML5: Semantic markup for structure and accessibility.
CSS3: Modern styling with custom properties and animations.
JavaScript (ES6+): Core logic, DOM manipulation, and EmailJS for form submission.
